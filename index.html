<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<section>
<p> My name is Faith Flynn, I am currently a junior at UW-Madison and a direct admit to the BBA program at the university. <br>
I am a marketing major pursuing a certificate in digital studies. I plan on graduating in December of 2021. Although I am <br>
just beginning my journey in the business world, I believe my eagerness to improve my skills in the field and my readiness <br>
to achieve great things should put me ahead of others. I am a born leader and have incredible communication skills. <br>
Hardworking and persistence are two important traits I have and could put to good use. I hope to one day be a marketing <br>
manager of a music or fashion corporation and push for women in the business world to dream big. I want to create a career <br>
for myself that I enjoy everyday, can express myself creatively in, and am passionate about. </p>
