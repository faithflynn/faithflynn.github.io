<h2>Who I Am</h2>
<section>
<p> My name is Faith Flynn, I am currently a senior at UW-Madison and was a direct admit to the BBA program at the university. <br>
I am a marketing major pursuing a certificate in digital studies. I plan on graduating in December of 2021. Although I am <br>
just beginning my journey in the business world, I believe my eagerness to improve my skills in the field and my readiness <br>
to achieve great things should put me ahead of others. I am a born leader and have incredible communication skills. <br>
Two important traits I have and could put to good use are adaptability and detail orientation. My main aspirations are in graphic design <br>
and social media management, and I hope to one day be a digital marketing manager of a music or fashion corporation. I want to push for <br>
women in the business world to dream big and continue to claim the professional world as our own. I want to create a career for myself <br>
that I enjoy everyday, can express myself creatively in, and am passionate about. <br>
<br>
Thank you for getting to know me, and I hope you find my work to be as compelling and as useful as I do. </p>
